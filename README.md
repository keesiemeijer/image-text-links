image-text-links
================

A WorPress plugin to easily insert text links, linking to an image attachment.

I made this plugin for one site were we don't insert images into posts but have text links linking to the full images. Now all all we have to do is upload the images to a post, select text in the editor and click an image in a metabox. This will make the selected text link to the full image. 
This plugin is an altered verion of the Gallery Metabox by Bill Erickson.
